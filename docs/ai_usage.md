I used Chat-gpt for problems 1-9 
The way I did this is by first inserting the problem into AI and asking for it to explain the problem 
Then I asked it to write the code for the problem, once I got the first answer, I downloaded the data from Roselind and then reinserted that file back into Chat-gpt to rewrite the code 
Finally to check to make sure the answer was right I troubleshooted Chat-gpt to make it check its work and then I check its work with inserting the answer into the Roselind problem.
